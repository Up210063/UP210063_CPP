## WHAT IS THE PURPOSE FOR THIS PROJECT?
    The main purpose for this project was to be able to improve our ability to develop code in the c++ language using function prototyping to be able to use them in other functions within this same code.
    the c++ language is very extensive and thanks to that we can do many things with this language. in this particular case we were with a matrix which would serve as our game board. In the first instance, the board needed to be divided by arrangements in the form of " | " and " _ "
