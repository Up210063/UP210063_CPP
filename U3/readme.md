## WHAT IS THE PURPOSE FOR THIS PROJECT?
    The main purpose for this project was to be able to 
    improve our ability to develop code in the c++ 
    language using function prototyping to be able to use 
    them in other functions within this same code.

    The c++ language is very extensive and thanks 
    to that we can do many things with this language. 
    In this particular case we were with a matrix 
    which would serve as our game board. In the first 
    instance, the board needed to be divided by arrangements 
    in the form of " | " and " _ "
